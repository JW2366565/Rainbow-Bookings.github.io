  It is the smallest Province of South Africa's nine Provinces. However, Gauteng accounts for only 1.5% of the

<div class="hide"><div class="limpopo">Steeped in history, the Limpopo Province celebrates a rich cultural heritage. 
  The province has many of South Africa's archaeological sites where the mysteries of the past and ancient 
  peoples are still being unearthed. The present tranquillity of the Limpopo Province belies a turbulent past, 
  to which many monuments and museums attest.

  The Pedi nation formed their homeland centuries ago in the platinum-rich eastern parts of the current Limpopo Province. 
  They had to adapt to the harsh landscape that characterised the region. With the arrival of the Voortrekkers circumstances changed 
  radically for the indigenous tribes and conflicts between them and the Voortrekkers started to occur. The Voortrekkers where European 
  settlers who left the Cape to start a new life in the unknown wilderness of the hinterland.
  
  This invasion of their territory by Europeans led to serious conflict and resulted in many bloody battles. 
  The history of the Limpopo Province is characterised by numerous incidents of settlement and conflict, of war and peace. 
  The Anglo-Boer War was one of main causes of the many historical battle fought in the Limpopo Province. In Haenertsberg the 
  statue of the Long Tom cannon was erected as a memorial to the battles fought on and for this land.
  
  Makapansgat Caves and limeworks near Mokopane are an archaeological site of global importance, reflecting the lifestyle and 
  culture of the first people to discover gold and thrive on the area's bushveld plains. During the Battle of Makapan soldiers 
  found sanctuary from attackers in a place once used as the home of a Stone Age tribe.</div>

                <div class="myDIV">History of the Free State</div>
                <div class="hide">When the Voortrekkers move away from the Cape Colony in the great Trek, some of them 
                  settled just north of Orange River, which formed the border between the Cape Colony and the rest of South Africa. 
                  There they founded many towns and farms. But they soon came into conflict with some of the black groups, especially the Basotho. 
                  The Basotho were a black nation which was found by Moshoeshoe after the mfecane. Their capital was at Thaba Bosui, which means 
                  Mountain of the Night in Sotho. In 1853 the Boers (as the Voortrekkers who had settled in the new republics were now called) declared 
                  the area the Orange Free State, a Boer republic like the ZAR.

                  They fight against Moshoeshoe many times, mostly over who owned what land and where the border between the OFS and the Basotho- 
                  kingdom actually was. During the protracted Second Basotho War of 1864 to 1868, Moshoeshoe asked for British protection to protect his Kingdom. 
                  The Basotho kingdom became a British protectorate and the Second Basotho War came to an end. As a measure to appease the Boers, the British 
                  granted most of the Basotho’s fertile land to the Orange Free State creating the current Lesotho borders with the Free State.
                  
                  When the Anglo- Boer War broke out in 1899, the Orange Free State helped the ZAR to fight against the British. But in 1902 the
                   Boers lost the war and their republics became the British colonies. The name of the Orange Free State was changed to the Orange River Colony. 
                   In 1910, it became one of the provinces of the new Union of South Africa, and the name was changed back to the Orange Free State. 
                   After South Africa’s transition to democracy the Orange Free State became a South African province and the name was changed to Free State.</div>

<div class="hide">In 1993, the Cape Province was divided into three smaller provinces. One of them is the Western Cape. 
  The Western Cape was the first place in the country where people from Europe settled. The Europeans brought slaves from Malay 
  to serve them, and the Malay culture became part of South Africa own heritage. Some of the buildings in Cape Town are more than 300 years old. 
  In the Cape, as many languages like Dutch, French, German and Malay were spoken, these were mixed to form a new language called Afrikaans that is 
  unique to South Africa. The word 'Afrikaans' means 'African' in Dutch. Today, Afrikaans is the third most widely spoken home language in South Africa, 
  after isiZulu and isiXhosa.</div>

<div class="hide"> In 1497 the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, coming from the opposite direction, reached the coast from around the 
  Cape of Good Hope. He gave the region the name Terra Natalis, because he first saw it on Christmas day (Natal is Portuguese for “Christmas”). 
  Da Gama probably did not go ashore.

  By the 1500s, the interior of Natal was settled by the Nguni branch of the Bantu-speaking peoples. 
  They were ancestors of the Zulu and other groups. By the 1800s there were mainly Zulu living in Natal north 
  of the Tugela River. Under the successive leadership of the chieftains Dingiswayo, Shaka, and Dingane, the Zulu built up an empire.
  
  Meanwhile, starting in 1824, British traders founded Port Natal (now Durban) on the coast. Another group of Europeans,
   the Boers, arrived in Natal from the west during their Great Trek away from Great Britain’s Cape Colony. The Boers fought 
   several battles with the Zulu and finally defeated Dingane at the Battle of Blood River (or Ncome River) in 1838. The Boers founded 
   the Republic of Natal, but the British annexed it in 1843. Most of the Boers left, and immigrants came from Britain to take their place.</div>

<div class="hide">Beginning about 1650, Europeans settled in southern Africa. Some of the first were the Dutch settlers whose 
  descendants became known as Boers. A major event in the history of the Northern Cape occurred in 1867, when diamonds were discovered 
  in Griqualand West—an area near the confluence of the Orange and Vaal rivers, in the eastern part of the present Northern Cape province. 
  The Griquas were a group of people of mixed white and Khoekhoe ancestry who had settled in the area in the late 1700s after being mistreated 
  in Cape Town. Soon the British, the Boers, and the Griquas all tried to claim the region for their own. The British took over the region in October 1871 
  and made it part of their Cape Colony.  The Northern Cape played an important role in the South African War (1899–1902), 
  also called the Boer War or Second Boer War. One of the biggest battles was on December 11, 1899, at Magersfontein. 
  The Boers won that battle with new fighting techniques; they used trenches so that the enemy could not see them. The British won the
   war, however, and took over all of the Boer territories. When the Union of South Africa was formed in 1910, the Cape Colony became the Cape 
   Province. In 1994, when South Africa’s apartheid-era government ended, the four historic provinces of South Africa were reorganized into nine new provinces.
    The Northern Cape was formed from part of the Cape Province.</div>

<div class="hide">It was in the North West Province, in 1838, where General Potgieter settled after he defeated the armies of Mzilikazi 
  at Kapain and Mosega. He was assisted in this effort by the Griqua and the Barolong, a terrorised tribe.

  Some of ancestors of these people still live in North West. Potgieter later left the area but not before founding the oldest town, 
  north of the Vaal River, in South Africa, namely Potchefstroom.  Mahikeng was in the main stream of South African history again during the early years 
  of the Anglo-Boer War when the Boer forces besieged the town for 217 days, from 1899 until May 1900; during which time Sol Plaatje wrote his literary 
  masterpiece "The Boer War Diary of Sol T Plaatje: an African at Mafikeng".

  Plaatje was later to become one of the founding fathers of the South African Native National Congress, 
  the forerunner of the African National Congress, in 1912.
  
  The first phase of the Anglo-Boer War lasted less than a year and was followed by two years of guerilla warfare. 
  During that phase more engagements took place in the then Western Transvaal than in any other part of the country.
  
  Apart from the famous siege of Mafikeng, no less than 20 significant engagements took place during the 20 months 
  between 7 August 1900 and 11 April 1902. These battles were spread evenly across the old Western Transvaal, now the Eastern half of the North West Province.</div>
